Create a program which converts hexadecimal numbers into decimal representation and vice versa.


Prerequisites
1)hexadecimal number is a string with prefix '0x'

Example: 0xFF; 0x102c

2)all strings not having prefix '0x' are treated as decimal numbers


Requirements:
1)program name: HexDec_Converter
2)input:
- is given by user directly
- is read from file, when program is started with parameter like this: HexDec_Converter -i<file path>
Note: if full path is not given, then file is expected to be in current folder
3)input form:
- input can contain 1-n values, separators are " " or "," or ";" or CR (line break)
- hexadecimal and decimal values can be both in the same string

Example: 0xAC, 23456; 0x12 345
  125, 89

4)output:
- output is table including 2 columns: "input value" and "output value"
- if input is not valid, then in output column there is a text: "is not valid hexadecimal value" or "is not valid decimal value"
- output is printed directly to the user interface or to the file  when executed with parameter HexDec_Converter -o<file path>, 
  note: output file should not overwrite input file
